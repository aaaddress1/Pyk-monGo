# PykemonGo
Play PokémonGo without hands, Based on Python, and Easy to fix.

This Project is forked from [rubenvereecken/pokemongo-api](github.com/rubenvereecken/pokemongo-api), request Python2.7

Although there're a lot of Python API for developers in Github, you still feel difficult to find a project to use without thinking when you're looking for a python bot.

So I make a easy python script of PokémonGo bot, you can build your bot easily on macOS, Linux, Ubuntu, etc. (I don't sure python will work well on Windows?)

1. `git clone https://github.com/aaaddress1/PykemonGo`
2. `cd ./PyKemonGo`
3. `pip install -r ./requirements.txt`

6. Cheers!
